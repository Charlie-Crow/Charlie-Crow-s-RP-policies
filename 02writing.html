                <h1 style="border-bottom: 1px solid white;">GENRES</h1>
                <strong>Fantasy.</strong> It’s the genre I’m the most familiar with because my very first stories and
                characters
                were in a Fantasy setting. Although it's not really the genre I'm craving for right now.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Supernatural, Urban Fantasy.</strong> Our world, our reality, but with supernatural turns and
                creatures, mystery and suspense.
                Vampires, werewolves, ghosts, and many other things we can talk about. It’s also a genre I’m very
                familiar
                with, I would be thrilled to RP that kind of stuff!
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Sci-fi.</strong> I’m less familiar with that one, but man I enjoy RPing Sci-fi. I have several
                species I
                can include in a space opera RP, just ask!
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Horror.</strong> I enjoy mystery, suspense, weird, monsters hiding in the dark, as well as the
                dark hiding
                in humans.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Modern, real life.</strong> I also enjoy a good slice-of-life RP, as long as romance or smut is
                not the absolute
                goal/central theme and if we come up with an interesting plot.
                <br>

                <strong>Want to RP in one of my original settings? Let me tell you a few things about them.</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Primordial Chaos.</strong>
                <br> My old-established, Fantasy story. It exists for at least 10 years.
                <br>
                <i>Vast oceans. Endless hills and dunes. Deep mountains. Several nations, several powerful abilities
                    that are deeply rooted in their nature. However, anyone using them is severely punished. In this
                    world of opression and prejudice, ancient stories about the Primordial Five are whispered while the
                    populations begin to face more and more mysteries; a giant roaming the coldest lands after a long,
                    dreamless sleep, and a foreign
                    traveler with very ominous markings staining her skin: Chaos' mark.
                </i>
                <br>
                <br>

                <strong>Code:MIRROR.</strong>
                <br> A Sci-fi, Cyberpunk setting. The story takes place on a futuristic Earth.
                <br>
                <i>Technology is everywhere, in any aspect of people’s lives. It has never been more efficient and has
                    never raised so many questions. However, it seems to be useless to understand or stop those
                    strange, expanding blue zones appearing all around the world. This is foreign, this is Alien, this is destructive. And it is
                    dangerous.</i>
                <br>
                <br>

                <strong>Cocoon.</strong>
                <br> Sci-fi, space opera.
                <br>
                <i>Peyregora is a Terpsy mothership, a city-like vessel floating in outer space. A lot of explorers and
                    scientists
                    are on board, seeking answers and other secrets in the cosmos. But they’re not alone in those cold,
                    infinite
                    darkness; giant creatures, hostile planets, silent ships with crews of hunters… Everything one can
                    imagine
                    seems to exist at some point. You realize it when you come across your worst fear.</i>
                <br>
                <br>

                <!-- <strong>Of Beasts and Men.</strong>
                <br> Fantastic/Supernatural setting. Very new and experimental.
                <br>
                <i>Scientists have messed with DNAs, proving that human hybrids can be viable. But what is the price to
                    pay
                    for those unwilling test subjects? They are a common sight nowadays, they have rights, they
                    co-exist
                    with humans. But relationships between Men and Beasts are not always peaceful, and intolerance is
                    everywhere,
                    on both sides.</i> -->
