            <p>My name is Charlie. I am a 23-year-old, very laid back guy with an unconditional love for writing original, authentic
                characters in all kinds of settings and genres. I’ve RPed for more than a decade and I’m in the process of
                writing a novel (I have several drafts and ideas actually but I’m pretty messy). I will preferably RP with
                people who are in their twenties or older, not only because of sensitive topics that we may write about,
                but maturity of mind and style as well.
                <br>I’m in CET, but I don’t mind if you’re not in the same time zone; I tend to prefer slow-paced, literate RPs
                if we’re going to write together on long term. I can rarely do real time.
            </p>

            <p>Don’t be shy OOC; I like to chat about characters, plots and drama if our styles match and if we get along. How
                do we get along? Don’t spam me, don’t be hunched over my shoulder all the time, give me space, be friendly,
                respectful, and we should be okay! Other than that, I’m an aspiring illustrator and graphic designer, I like
                to code a little bit too (HTML/CSS mainly), but I’m not a pro. Want an example? Well, I coded this little
                website. Also, I love to draw comics, even if I’m still not completely ready to post the actual stuff.
                <br>Outside of art and RP, I love rain, storms, hot chocolate, soft blankets, nature, animals (especially my
                cat and my rat). Yeah, I’m an indoor shadow creature.
            </p>

            <p style="color: rgb(88, 72, 161);">// Currently on break from RP; I can't start any other plots right now because I lack time... But if you still want to chat, go ahead! //</p>
