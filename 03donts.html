                <h1>First, keep in mind that:</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>I prefer to RP with 18+ people,</strong> for the sake of maturity and sensitive topics.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <strong>English is not my mother tongue.</strong> So if a sentence sounds weird to you, feel
                        free to nicely
                        point out the mistake.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Real time is rarely possible for me.</strong> Most people I RP with are not in the same
                        time zone
                        as me. I can do real time on the week-ends depending on where you are, but I mainly do slow
                        paced
                        RPs (1-2 responses per day; more if I have more free time, less if I have stuff to do).</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <strong>About that:</strong> I can have a very busy schedule. Sometimes I can reply once (or
                        several times) a day, some other times only once per week or so. If you’re expecting full
                        devotion at any time, then I’m not the person you’re looking for. However I will give you a
                        head-up
                        if I know I'm going to be AFK for several days, or if I know I won't be able to answer in more
                        than two weeks.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <h1>What I will do:</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Mixing genres.</strong> That’s a thing I love to do when I build worlds and stories.
                        For example, I’m a big fan
                        of Sci-fi/Horror, but also Fantasy/Steampunk, Fantastic/Sci-fi… You can come to me with a list
                        of
                        your own preferences if you want! We can discuss the ideas we both like!</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Plot-driven RPs.</strong> A story arc with good characters and plot-twists is preferred
                        for long term RPs. It
                        can be more or less complex, it depends on what we want to do.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Simpler RPs.</strong> Our characters meet each other, we don’t plan anything and see
                        where it leads us.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Any kind of pairings,</strong> at least if the RP involves romance.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Gore, violence and sexual themes.</strong> I will write these if they fit in the story,
                        but it’s something we
                        need to discuss beforehand.</li>
                    <br>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                <h1>Immediate no-noes:</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Intolerant, discriminatory behaviours.</strong> Your character can be an arse toward
                        another one, but as a player,
                        please be respectful of difference: gender identities, sexualities, ethnicities, etc. I have
                        several
                        characters who are not straight and/or cisgender and are from very different origins, and I
                        won’t
                        tolerate people being dicks about it.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Romance RP.</strong> I have nothing against it really, but I did lots of romance themed
                        RPs in the past and I’m
                        kinda fed up of them. Besides, I have always preferred plot driven RPs rather than romance
                        driven
                        stories. Romance can happen naturally if it fits, if we’re both feeling like it, and if we
                        discuss
                        it beforehand, but I most likely won’t like it to be the central element, especially if we’ve
                        never
                        RPed together before. Same thing goes with smut.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Non-consensual sex and rape of any kind.</strong> That is a theme I don’t feel
                        comfortable writing in RP.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Do not force yourself to do anything.</strong> If I push the RP in a direction you
                        don’t like, say it. I promise
                        I will do the same and tell you if you do something that I don’t like. Rp is supposed to be
                        fun;
                        I don’t want to ruin anyone’s experience, and I don’t want anyone to ruin mine.</li>
